## Context

In consideration of the following requirements:

- **[FR5]** - Review of vital signs history is possible, filtering on time range as well as vital sign
- **[FR10]** - Generate holistic snapshots from a patients consolidated vital signs at any time

And with assumption that medical staff may need to access cloud-based solution MyMedicalData and MonitorThem, 
we assume that we need to configure up to 25 computer devices on nurse stations in the hospital, independent of monitoring screens.

## Decision

We can use workstations with browser to access MonitorMe system, as well as other StayHealthy, Inc. systems.

## Consequences
